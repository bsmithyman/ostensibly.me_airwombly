My name is Brendan Smithyman. I'm a geophysicist working on seismic full-waveform inversion, but I have very broad interests. I am currently (as of March, 2014) a postdoctoral fellow at the [Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modeling](https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/), at [UBC](http://www.ubc.ca/). You can find some of my work [on GitHub](https://github.com/bsmithyman).
