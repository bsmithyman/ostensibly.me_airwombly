title: And so it begins...
---

My name is Brendan Smithyman. I'm a geophysicist working on seismic full-waveform inversion, but I have very broad interests. I am currently (as of March, 2014) a postdoctoral fellow at the [Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modeling](https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/), at [UBC](http://www.ubc.ca/). You can find some of my work [on GitHub](https://github.com/bsmithyman).

I've never been all that good about keeping a blog up to date, but the main impediment for most websites is lack of content. I'm certainly not lacking for interests, and interests + time potentially leads to content. I think that this could be the beginning of a beautiful thing (or a lurching monstrosity that endangers life as we know it). Let's find out.
